# FIRST PROBLEM

This PHP script groups consecutive numbers according to a set of input numbers.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `ranges.php` file to your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.

The `htdocs` directory is typically located at:

- Windows: `C:\xampp\htdocs`

3. Start your XAMPP server.

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/ranges.php`.

You should see the grouped consecutive numbers as a result.

## Example

Input: "1 2 3 5 6 8"

Output: "1-3, 5-6, 8"
